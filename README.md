# AgriLink 🌱

## *Direct from Farm, Fair for All*


## Overview
AgriLink is an Ethiopia-based AgTech platform designed to connect smallholder farmers directly with urban consumers through a transparent, government-aligned agricultural supply chain. The project addresses inefficiencies in the agricultural value chain by reducing middlemen, stabilizing farmer incomes, improving logistics, and ensuring affordable, quality-assured food access for urban markets.

AgriLink combines simple digital technologies with physical infrastructure (branches, warehouses, logistics partnerships) to create a scalable and inclusive farmer-to-consumer ecosystem.
